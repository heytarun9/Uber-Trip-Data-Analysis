# ðŸš– Uber Rides Analysis (Jan-Feb 2015)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes Uber rides data from January and February 2015, cleans and processes the dataset, 
and visualizes key metrics using **Power BI**.  
The cleaned dataset is optimized for analytics and can be used for further business insights.

**Rows:** 354  
**Columns:** 11

### Columns in Cleaned Dataset:
- **dispatching_base_number**: The unique base number of the Uber dispatch base.
- **date**: The ride date (YYYY-MM-DD).
- **active_vehicles**: Number of active vehicles for that date.
- **trips**: Total number of trips on that date.
- **pickup_datetime**: Date and time of trip pickup.

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Process
1. **Removed Duplicates** â€“ Ensured no repeated records.
2. **Handled Missing Values** â€“ Filled or removed null entries.
3. **Standardized Date Formats** â€“ Converted `date` and `pickup_datetime` to proper datetime objects.
4. **Extracted Date Components** â€“ Added `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, and `weekday` columns.
5. **Created Weekend Indicator** â€“ Added `is_weekend` boolean column.

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Daily Trips Trend** â€“ Observed peaks and drops in ride demand.
- **Hourly Distribution** â€“ Identified busy hours.
- **Weekday vs Weekend** â€“ Compared ride counts for weekdays and weekends.
- **Base Code Performance** â€“ Compared trips for different Uber bases.

## ðŸ“ˆ Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides interactive visual insights.

### Visuals Included:
1. **KPI Cards** â€“ Total Trips, Total Active Vehicles, MoM % Change.
2. **Line Chart** â€“ Trips over time.
3. **Bar Chart** â€“ Base-wise trips.
4. **Donut Chart** â€“ Trips share by base.
5. **Table** â€“ Date, Base, Active Vehicles, Trips.

### Key DAX Measures:
```DAX
Total Trips = SUM('Table'[trips])
Total Vehicles = SUM('Table'[active_vehicles])
Trips MoM% = DIVIDE(
    [Total Trips] - CALCULATE([Total Trips], DATEADD('Table'[date], -1, MONTH)),
    CALCULATE([Total Trips], DATEADD('Table'[date], -1, MONTH)),
    0
)
```
